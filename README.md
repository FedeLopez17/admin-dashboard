## Description:
This is the seventh project I have tackled while working my way through [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).<br>
The [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) was to re-create an admin dashboard based on a design file provided, and give it our own spin afterwards.<br>
Furthermore, it served as an introduction to the CSS Grid Layout Module.<br>
I had a great time working on this project, and despite it being far from perfect, I am quite happy with how it turned out.

## Technologies used:

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

## New things learned:
- What the CSS Grid Layout Module is and its use cases.
- How useful CSS fractional units and functions such as `repeat()` and `minmax()` can be when it comes to responsive design.
- The subtle difference between `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`.
- That rather than there being a superior layout module, Flexbox and Grid are complementary tools that can work together, and choosing which one to use for a specific task depends on many different factors.
- How much of a difference the colour palette chosen can make.
- How advantageous CSS variables are.
- How convenient outlines and borders can be when making layouts.

## Areas for improvement:
- Use semantic elements more often.
- Have more structure in my HTML / CSS from the beginning.
- Commit more frequently.

## Funny details:
I always try to add a few silly jokes to my projects. This project wasn't the exception.<br>
A creative joke I came up with for this project was making the little eye symbols blink at random time intervals.<br>
The reaction I was going for was users second-guessing whether they had actually seen an eye blink. (Which was, to my delight, exactly what happened upon showing the page to one of my friends).<br>
Deciding within which range to set the function making the eyes blink was definitely a challenge.
If they took too long to blink, the user might be already gone by the time they were supposed to blink, but if they constantly blinked it would unarguably lose its point.<br>
Besides, messages with silly jokes and puns pop up when the profile-pictures are clicked. 
I think this was a fun touch, and I'm pleased with how the animations look.<br>
There are a few more little "easter eggs" I won't mention for obvious reasons.
